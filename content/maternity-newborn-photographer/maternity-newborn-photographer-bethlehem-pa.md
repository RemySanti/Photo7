## FAQs for Maternity & Newborn Photography in Bethlehem, PA

**When should we schedule our maternity session?**  
The ideal time is between 30-36 weeks of pregnancy when your bump is beautifully round but you're still comfortable moving and posing. However, I'm happy to work with your preferred timing.

**How soon after birth should we book newborn photos?**  
The best window is 5-14 days old when babies are sleepiest and most flexible for those curled-up poses. However, I photograph newborns at any age and adjust my approach accordingly.

**What if my baby won't settle during the newborn session?**  
Completely normal! I build in extra time for feeding, changing, and soothing. Sometimes babies have alert days—we'll capture awake portraits, and if needed, we can schedule a brief follow-up.

**Do you photograph twins?**  
Yes! Twin sessions require extra time and patience. I have experience safely posing and photographing multiples and adjust session length accordingly.
